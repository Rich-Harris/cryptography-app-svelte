# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community and are happy to have them. Please follow this guide when logging issues or making changes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/routes` contains the main pages of the app
- `src/routes/cipher/[route]` the slug `[route]` represents different pages for the ciphers that are mentioned in the `README.md` file
- each cipher is a component present in the `src/lib/ciphers` route and is brought in the `+page.svelte` file for each `src/routes/cipher/[route]` of the cipher routes and are placed appropriately just as a single component whereas for each sub-route within the `cipher` route, there is a +layout.svelte present that gives the initial layout to the routes after `cipher` that is the cipher alogrithm.
